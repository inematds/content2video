## Frame 6 — Três barreiras abertas

- scene: Três barreiras bloqueiam um caminho contínuo: transferir entre domínios, criar com emoção e perceber o mundo físico.
- voiceover: "E ainda faltam três saltos: transferir conhecimento entre domínios, reproduzir criatividade emocional e perceber o mundo físico com riqueza humana."

- focal: percurso vertical interrompido por três estações
- roles: trilho coral = camera path; TRANSFERÊNCIA, EMOÇÃO e PERCEPÇÃO = stations; ícones lineares = supporting; papel com cartografia mono = background

narrativeRole: Torna concretos os desafios que mantêm a AGI fora do alcance atual.
keyMessage: Generalização, emoção e percepção sensorial continuam sem solução equivalente à humana.

Adapt: mantém um único mundo maior que o quadro e a câmera percorrendo estações; gira o percurso para o eixo vertical do 9:16 e termina numa lacuna, não num nó caótico.
Scene 1 (0.0–1.5s): a câmera abre na etiqueta “TRÊS SALTOS”; um trilho coral desenha para baixo e começa o pan vertical (`viewport-change` + `svg-path-draw`).
Scene 2 (1.5–3.6s): a câmera estaciona em TRANSFERÊNCIA; dois domínios permanecem separados por uma ponte incompleta e o label entra no cue.
Scene 3 (3.6–5.6s): novo pan chega a EMOÇÃO; uma forma lógica encontra um pulso irregular, mas os dois não se fundem. A câmera volta a ficar estática durante a leitura.
Scene 4 (5.6–7.1s): último pan chega a PERCEPÇÃO; olho, ouvido e mão aparecem por SVG self-draw (`svg-icon-enrichment` + `svg-path-draw`).
Scene 5 (7.1–8.04s): o trilho termina antes de “Riqueza humana”; a lacuna fica visível e o quadro segura, sem push adicional.

## Selected blueprint: spatial-pan-stations

# spatial-pan-stations — Spatial Pan / Stations

**intent**: Pre-place a sequence of labeled stations on one oversized canvas, then traverse it with a single virtual camera — repeated lateral/diagonal pans that center each station in turn and reveal a callout at every stop, landing held on a final station.

**roles served**

- Hook (from hook-pan-timeline): a horizontal timeline of evenly-spaced milestones, left-panned beat by beat, each marker getting a spring-popped callout, landing on the present moment ("evolution / milestone walk leading up to us").
- Problem (from problem-camera-pan-stations): a connected web of pain "stations" linked by hand-drawn leading lines, diagonally panned station to station, ending on a tangled scribble knot ("too many disconnected steps — it's a mess").
- Product_Intro (from concept-demo-decode-pan): a two-shot strip bridged by ONE lateral pan — shot 1 holds a static phrase whose accent word 3D-flap-DECODES (the concept lands), then the camera pans across the strip (with background parallax) into shot 2, where a cursor drives a live typing demo. Pairs this pan with `cursor-ui-demo`'s focal-locked tracked typing.

**duration**: 7–10s (union of Hook 8–10s, Problem ~7s, concept-demo ~7s)

**shot structure**
One oversized flat canvas on a solid `[bg color]`; all stations/markers pre-placed in world space; `[accent color]` text + simple line-icons; one virtual `.world` camera pans ease-in-out between stops. Each station holds ~1.0s.

- Scene 1 (0.0–~1.0s): Camera opens on station 1 — `[label 1 / first step]` centered. A reveal lands on it (see variants). Camera then begins to PAN toward station 2, sliding station 1 out of frame.
- Scene 2 → Scene N-1 (~1.0s each): Camera PANS (ease-in-out) to center the next station; on arrival its `[label k]` (+ optional `[secondary label]`) is REVEALED with the role reveal. Repeat per station.
- Scene N (final, ~last beat): One last pan lands on the terminal station; the final `[callout / landing element]` reveals and HOLDS to the end. Camera goes static on the punchline.

- Variant — Hook: stations sit as evenly-spaced `[markers]` on a thin horizontal `[timeline]` (lower third); pans are LEFT-only along the single axis (timeline scrolls left). Each callout is a bordered `[callout box]` + downward triangle (offset drop-shadow) that SPRING-POPS up (scale 0→100%, bouncy overshoot, transform-origin at triangle tip) reading `[label k]`; a `[secondary label, e.g. year]` fades in and RISES above it. Some mid markers arrive as plain static text revealed by the pan alone (no box). Final scene lands on the `[present-day label]`, springs, holds.
- Variant — Problem: stations are scattered across a 2D web; pans are DIAGONAL, STEERED by `[accent color]` hand-drawn lines — each station has a rough write-on line/arrow that draws toward the next and the camera follows it (Scene 1 also draws a loop/circle around the headline's key word). Each station = a white `[line-icon]` above its `[label]`, revealed plainly by the pan (no spring box). Final scene: the accent line spirals into a dense chaotic SCRIBBLE KNOT centered on the field; camera holds static on the tangle (visual punchline).

**motion vocabulary**
repeated ease-in-out camera pans (horizontal-left for Hook, diagonal-steered for Problem) across one large static canvas; pre-placed stations sliding through frame via the pan; spring-overshoot callout pop with triangle-tip origin (Hook); rise-and-fade secondary label (Hook); plain labels/icons arriving via the pan alone; rough hand-drawn "write-on" leading lines/arrows + loop/circle key-word mark (Problem); terminal chaotic-scribble knot draw (Problem); static hold on the final station/punchline.

**rule mapping**

- camera pan / traverse across the canvas (primary) → `viewport-change` (single `.world` wrapper transform; PAN mode)
- sequencing the repeated pan beats into stops → `multi-phase-camera`
- centering each station as the pan target → `coordinate-target-zoom` (used as pan-to-target, no zoom)
- spring-overshoot callout pop, triangle-tip origin (Hook) → `spring-pop-entrance`
- rise-and-fade secondary label + plain per-station label/icon reveals via the pan → `discrete-text-sequence`
- hand-drawn leading lines / arrows / loop-circle key-word mark / terminal scribble knot (Problem) → `svg-path-draw`
- station line-icons (Problem) → `svg-icon-enrichment`
- static hold on the final station / punchline → (no motion; sustained held frame, no rule needed)

**camera modifier**: The pan IS the camera. One `.world` virtual-camera transform in PAN mode — `viewport-change` — sequenced across stops by `multi-phase-camera`, each stop targeted via `coordinate-target-zoom` (pan-to-target). No depth push-in (that distinguishes this from the cluster-push-in / dataviz-pushthrough blueprints).

# SVG Icon Enrichment

Treats an SVG icon as a composition of animated PARTS, not an opaque image. Each meaningful internal element (a clock hand, scissor blade, recording dot, data line) gets its own micro-animation, targeted by id. Distinct from [svg-path-draw](svg-path-draw.md) (which animates the OUTLINE drawing) — enrichment animates INTERNAL PARTS, ideally after the outline has drawn.

Four signature patterns:

| Pattern     | Use For                            | Math                                  | Tip                                |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Rotation    | Clock, gear, loader, dial          | `rotate(deg cx cy)` attribute, linear | see the transform-center gotcha    |
| Oscillation | Scissors, wings, toggle            | `rotate(±sin·amp)` on opposing groups | opposite signs on the two parts    |
| Pulse       | Recording dot, heart, notification | `scale(1 + sin·amp)` + opacity        | ring lags dot by π/2 for ripple    |
| Dash flow   | Cutting line, data stream          | `strokeDashoffset` linear via time    | negative for L→R, positive for R→L |

## ❗ The transform-center gotcha

**For rotation around an explicit point inside an SVG, use the SVG `transform` ATTRIBUTE, not CSS transform**: `el.setAttribute("transform", `rotate(${deg} ${cx} ${cy})`)`. The CSS combination `transform: rotate(...)` + `transform-origin: 60px 60px` + `transform-box: fill-box` interprets the origin in the element's OWN **bbox-local** coordinates, NOT viewBox coordinates. For a thin `<line>` (whose bbox is the line's narrow envelope), `60 60` bbox-local is a point OUTSIDE the line — the hand flies along an off-center arc instead of rotating in place. Same trap for small inner shapes (a dot circle whose bbox is the small circle, not the full viewBox).

**Scaling around a center point**: same attribute route — `el.setAttribute("transform", `translate(${cx} ${cy}) scale(${s}) translate(-${cx} -${cy})`)`.

// Pattern 1 — Rotation. Proxy tween → SVG transform attribute (explicit center, see gotcha).
const hand = document.getElementById("hand-min");

      const sR = 1 + Math.sin(pulse.p + Math.PI / 2) * PULSE_RING_AMP;
      dot.setAttribute("transform", `translate(60 60) scale(${sD}) translate(-60 -60)`);

      document.getElementById("data-flow").style.strokeDashoffset = String(flowState.offset);
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Stroke draw → enrichment chain** — draw the outline first via [svg-path-draw](svg-path-draw.md) (phase 1, `0 → OUTLINE_DUR`), then start enrichment at `OUTLINE_DUR`: the icon "wakes up" after assembly.
- **Per-icon entry stagger** — for a row of icons, each icon's enrichment starts as it fades in, not synchronized.

| DASH_FLOW_TOTAL_OFFSET          | ±100–400             | must be an integer multiple of the dash period (dash + gap) or the end frame shows a phase jump |

## Critical Constraints

- **The transform-center gotcha above** — SVG `transform` attribute for any rotation/scale around an explicit interior point; never CSS `transform-origin` + `transform-box: fill-box` on thin lines or small inner shapes.
- **No `requestAnimationFrame`** — like CSS animation, it desyncs from HF's frame-by-frame seek; continuous motion lives inside the timeline as linear proxy tweens.
- **Amplitudes subtle** — icons are decorative, not headlines; calibrate rotation speed against composition length, not absolute time.
- **Phase-offset the parts** — minute vs second hand at different speeds, ring lagging dot by π/2. Pure sync looks mechanical.
- **`stroke-linecap: round`** on flowing/dashed lines for clean dash edges.
- **Climax dwell ≥1s** — if the enrichment is the headline beat, the composition continues ≥1s after the most dramatic moment.

# SVG Path Draw

Reveals an SVG shape by animating its stroke as if a pen were tracing it. Two stroke properties together: **`stroke-dasharray = <pathLength>`** makes the entire path one dash; **`stroke-dashoffset`** starts at the path length (dash shifted fully out of view → invisible) and tweens to `0` (fully drawn). The length comes from the DOM API `path.getTotalLength()` — measured, never guessed.

Works on anything with a stroke: `<path>`, `<circle>`, `<rect>`, `<line>`, `<polyline>`, `<polygon>`, `<ellipse>`.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip -->
<svg class="logo-mark" viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
  <path id="bar-left" d="M 60 40 L 60 160" />
  <path id="bar-right" d="M 140 40 L 140 160" />
  <path id="bar-mid" d="M 60 100 L 140 100" />
</svg>
```

```css
.logo-mark path {
  fill: none; /* outline-only draw — a fill would appear immediately and ruin the reveal */
  stroke: {accentColor};
  stroke-width: 12;
  stroke-linecap: round; /* softer endpoints */
  stroke-linejoin: round;
}
```

```js
// Setup: measure each path and set its dash pattern. Real measured geometry, not a magic number.
document.querySelectorAll(".logo-mark path").forEach((p) => {
  const len = p.getTotalLength();
  p.style.strokeDasharray = `${len}`;
  p.style.strokeDashoffset = `${len}`;
});

// Stagger draws so the eye reads continuous motion — each segment starts at
// ~70-80% of the previous segment's duration, before it finishes.
tl.to(
  "#bar-left",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-right",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_2_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#bar-mid",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_3_START,
);

// Companion wordmark fades in only after the last stroke settles.
tl.to(
  ".brand-line",
  { opacity: 1, duration: BRAND_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  BRAND_FADE_START,
);
```

## Variations

- **Ring starting at 12 o'clock** — `<circle>` / `<rect>` strokes start at 3 o'clock by default; rotate the element `-90deg` so a progress ring draws from the top:

```html
<circle
  cx="100"
  cy="100"
  r="60"
  id="ring"
  style="transform-origin: 100px 100px; transform: rotate(-90deg)"
/>
```

- **Linear (constant-speed) draw** — `ease: "none"` for a steady-rate "real pen" trace.
- **Draw then fill** — for filled shapes, tween `fillOpacity: 0 → 1` AFTER the stroke completes (requires `fill-opacity: 0` initially and a real `fill` in CSS):

```js
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { strokeDashoffset: 0, duration: SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR, ease: "power2.out" },
  SEG_1_START,
);
tl.to(
  "#path",
  { fillOpacity: 1, duration: FILL_FADE_DUR, ease: "power1.out" },
  SEG_1_START + SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR,
);
```

| FINAL_SEGMENT_DUR | 60–80% of SEGMENT_DRAW_DUR              | proportional to segment length — a short connector at full duration reads slower than its siblings |
| SEG_N_START       | previous start + 70–80% of its duration | reads as continuous motion, not N isolated animations                                              |
| SEG_1_START       | 0–0.4s                                  | a small ~0.2s lead-in lets the viewer settle before motion                                         |
| BRAND_FADE_START  | ≥ last stroke end (+ ~0.2s beat)        | earlier and the wordmark competes with the draw                                                    |
| BRAND_FADE_DUR    | 0.3–0.8s                                | snap (urgent) vs glide (premium)                                                                   |

Ease families are discrete choices: **stroke draws** use `power2.out` (a hand lifting at end of stroke) or `none` for constant speed — never `back.out` / `elastic.out` (pens don't bounce). **Fades** use `power1.out`.

## Critical Constraints

- **`fill: none`** for outline-only draws — otherwise the fill appears immediately.
- **Dasharray/dashoffset = the measured `getTotalLength()`**, set at setup; requires the SVG in the DOM (inline SVG is fine; a loaded `<image>` SVG is not).
- **Complex paths**: if `getTotalLength()` looks wrong, overestimate slightly (`len * 1.05`) — too large is invisible at animation start; too small clips the end.
- **Stagger multi-path draws at ~70–80%** of the previous segment's duration.
- **A drawn line must land on something.** When the path is a connector (rail, beam, underline, callout) rather than a shape, both endpoints must sit on real elements and the draw must do a job — reveal, route, validate, or emphasize. A stroke that only decorates empty space reads as filler; attach it or cut it.

# Viewport Change (Virtual Camera)

Simulates camera effects (zoom / pan / focus-lock on a moving element) by transforming a wrapper around ALL scene content. The "world" moves opposite to the perceived camera. Distinct from [multi-phase-camera](multi-phase-camera.md) (2-3 discrete phases + drift) — viewport-change is a single continuous zoom/pan, often used for focus-lock following a moving element.

## How It Works

Camera intent → world transform. Camera **pans right** → world `translateX(-distance)`; camera **zooms in** → world `scale(>1)`; camera **follows element X** → world `translateX(viewportCenter - elementWorldX)` per-frame. Get the sign right or everything moves the wrong way. The single `.world` wrapper holds the camera transform; elements inside are positioned in world space, unchanged.

**Single-element composite transform (this rule's form).** Both scale and translate live on ONE wrapper as `translate(x, y) scale(S)`. CSS applies scale FIRST, then translate (right-to-left matrix composition), so a point at world offset `(ox, oy)` lands on screen at `(S × ox + x, S × oy + y)`. To map the target to viewport center, solve `S × offset + T = 0`:

```
T = -offset × S
```

This is **different from [coordinate-target-zoom](coordinate-target-zoom.md)**, which uses two nested wrappers (outer scales, inner translates) and derives `T = -offset` (independent of S). Mixing up the two forms drifts the target off-center as scale changes. Use this single-wrapper form when you want one source of truth for camera state (`cam.scale`, `cam.x`, `cam.y`) written via `onUpdate`; use nested wrappers when scale and translate can tween independently with shared ease.

## Scale Value Guide

| Effect      | Scale       | Feel                                |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------------------------- |
| Subtle      | 1.02 - 1.05 | Barely perceptible — "professional" |
| Medium      | 1.05 - 1.15 | "Ta-da" emphasis                    |
| Noticeable  | 1.15 - 1.30 | Focus on region                     |
| Dramatic    | 1.5 - 2.5   | Element fills screen                |
| Full-screen | 3.0+        | Element covers viewport             |

Perception: < 5% scale change is imperceptible; 10-15% is comfortable emphasis; > 30% is cinematic/dramatic. For a natural product feel, prefer 1.05-1.15× over 2-3s; save big > 1.3× zooms for dramatic narrative moments.

### Extreme range — 4–12× outward (workspace reveal)

The same single-cam math runs far past the table: a zoom-out workspace reveal opens punched-in at **4–12×** on one detail (a single cell, message, or button) and pulls out to the full workspace in one continuous move. The mechanics don't change — one `cam` object, `T = -offset × S`, one `applyCamera()` writer — only the authoring direction does:

- **Build the workspace at its final (1×) layout and OPEN scaled-in** (`cam.scale = 8`, counter-translate aiming the opening detail; state it in a `fromTo` / seed via `applyCamera()` so a seek to t=0 lands punched-in). The wide landing frame is then everything at native design size — text crisp, raster assets at source resolution.
- **Never the inverse** — authoring the close-up at 1× and scaling the world down to 0.08–0.25 for the wide frame drops every label below legible pixel size and softens raster media; the reveal lands on mush.
- **Measure the opening target** — at S = 8, a 1 px error in the baked offset is 8 px on screen at the opening pose. Take the offset from the target's real laid-out center (`getBoundingClientRect` after `fonts.ready`, once at setup — the measuring doctrine in [coordinate-target-zoom.md](coordinate-target-zoom.md)), never from a layout formula.
- **The opening detail must survive ×S** — it renders at `S ×` its design size on the first frames (vector/DOM text is safe; raster needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × S`).

## Variations

- **Focus-lock (camera follows a moving cursor/character)** — keep the element at a fixed screen X by computing the world offset per-frame inside the driver's `onUpdate`:

```js
const focusEl = document.querySelector(".moving-cursor");
const targetScreenX = VIEWPORT_WIDTH * FOCUS_SCREEN_X_FRAC; // 0.4–0.7; 0.5 = dead center
const focusUpdate = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  focusUpdate,
  {
    p: 1,
    duration: FOLLOW_DUR, // matches how long the focused element is in motion
    ease: "power2.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      const rect = focusEl.getBoundingClientRect();
      cam.x = targetScreenX - (rect.left + rect.width / 2);
      applyCamera();
    },
  },
  FOLLOW_START,
);
```

- **Composite scale (multi-phase)** — two proxy tweens multiplied through one writer: `cam.scale = scaleUp.v * scaleDown.v; applyCamera()`. Combine a slow push-in (~1.15) with a brief release (~0.9) for a breath/punch shape.
- **Camera mode transition (centered → follow)** — crossfade two camera modes via a 0→1 weight tween; intermediate frames interpolate between the modes' offsets.

| --------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TARGET_OFFSET_Y | measured, not a free parameter       | target's offset from viewport center at neutral camera; measure via `getBoundingClientRect` |
| TARGET_SCALE    | 1.3× modest → 1.6–2.0× typical → 3×+ | raster media needs `sourceResolution ≥ rendered × TARGET_SCALE`                             |
| ZOOM_START      | content landed + ~0.5s scan time     | let the viewer read before the camera moves                                                 |
| ZOOM_DUR        | 1.0–2.0s                             | under 0.8s teleports, over 2.5s drags                                                       |
| DWELL           | ≥ 1.0s after the zoom settles        | the viewer must be able to read the focal point (climax dwell)                              |
| VIEWPORT_WIDTH  | = the root's `data-width`            | real value, not abstract                                                                    |

## Critical Constraints

- **One `.world` wrapper carries the whole camera** — every scene element lives inside it; a second transformed wrapper is a second camera.
- **Single source of truth via the `cam` object + `applyCamera()`** — when scale and translate both change, write them in ONE place; never split them across tweens that touch `world.style.transform` directly (the transform string composition order becomes unpredictable).
- **Single-wrapper counter-translate is `T = -offset × S`** — don't import the nested-wrapper `T = -offset` formula.
- **`overflow: hidden` on `.scene`**; **`transform-origin: 50% 50%` on `.world`**; **background on `.scene`, never on `.world`**.
