Adapt: mantém a colisão que substitui o ruído por um herói; o herói final é a promessa oficial do INEMA.CLUB.
Scene 1 (0.0–1.6s): só “MAIS UMA LISTA?” ocupa o terço superior; type-on com caret (`discrete-text-sequence`), composição assimétrica 70/30 com linhas ciano nas bordas.
Scene 2 (1.6–4.4s): o slot central alterna “FERRAMENTAS”, “CURSOS”, “TENDÊNCIAS” por in-place token cycle (`vertical-spring-ticker`), um termo por pista da voz; o restante do quadro continua vazio e tenso.
Scene 3 (4.4–6.2s): a palavra “CAMINHO” entra da direita com motion-blur streak (`motion-blur-streak`) e desloca fisicamente a lista (`reactive-displacement`); a peça oficial começa a ocupar o plano de fundo.
Scene 4 (6.2–7.704s): a peça oficial resolve nítida em card grande no topo de 75% do quadro; “USE IA DE VERDADE” segura no primeiro plano e permanece imóvel.

## Selected blueprint: ticker-takeover

# ticker-takeover — Ticker Displace / Takeover

**intent**: A context phrase types in, an accent word cycles through options like a slot-machine to suggest "this could be many things," then a hero CRASHES in from off-screen and physically shoves the text aside — "actually, this is what it is." A collision, not a fade.

**roles served**

- Hook (from `takeover-ticker-displace`): when a static lead-in phrase + a cycling accent word should be **physically replaced** (not cross-dissolved) by a hero arriving with momentum, and the final frame is the hero alone. Reach for it when the takeover should read as an impact.
- Brand_Outro: the same collision used as a sign-off — options cycle, the brand mark crashes in and owns the frame.

**duration**: 5–7s

**shot structure** (a `[bg]` canvas; one text group on the left/center that gets ejected by an incoming hero)

- **Scene 1 (0.0–~1.4s) — context build.** A typewriter lays down a `[lead-in phrase]` character-by-character (smooth, no typos — selling confidence, not human chaos). Camera static.
- **Scene 2 (~1.4–3.0s) — the cycling beat.** An `[accent word]` slot inside the line ticks through 2–3 `[options]` on a vertical spring-roll (each click a new word), suggesting breadth — "many things this could be." (More than ~3 reads as filler.)
- **Scene 3 (~3.0–4.2s) — the collision (signature move).** A `[hero]` crashes in from off-screen with momentum and physically SHOVES the whole text group aside — the text reacts to the impact (gets displaced), it does not fade. The hero lands **heavy** — a longer settle, not a zip — so it reads as mass, not speed.
- **Scene 4 (~4.2–end) — the hero alone.** The hero settles dead-center and reads still. Holds.

**motion vocabulary**: smooth character typewriter; vertical spring-ticker word roll (2–3 steps); off-screen hero crash-in with momentum; reactive displacement of the struck text group; heavy long-tail landing (not bouncy); dual-axis subtle jitter on the resting hero.

**rule mapping**

- smooth single-phrase typewriter lead-in → `discrete-text-sequence` (smooth-slice / continuous `floor(progress)` form — no typo machinery)
- accent word slot-machine cycling through options → `vertical-spring-ticker` (`STEPS` = number of options the hero will replace; the rule's footer-reveal is unused — Scene 3 takes its place)
- hero shoves the text group aside on impact → `reactive-displacement` (the text is the displaced mass; express the hero's "heavy land" as a longer `power2` settle, not the rule's default `back.out`)
- hero's fast off-screen crash-in → `motion-blur-streak` (directional velocity blur resolving sharp as it lands)
- resting-hero aliveness → `sine-wave-loop` (low-amplitude dual-frequency register — scale + rotation jitter composing onto the hero's final landed scale; never a yoyo around 1)

**camera modifier**: camera-static — the displacement happens in element space (the hero moves the text), so there is no real camera move; the impact is the only motion.

# Discrete Text Sequence

Instead of character-by-character typewriter, replace entire string states at time thresholds — enabling non-linear effects (typos, backspaces, bulk paste, "thinking" gaps) that smooth per-char typing can't achieve. If your effect is "type each character, no edits", this rule is overkill — use the smooth-slice variation below.

## How It Works

The typing is authored as a sparse array of `{ t, text }` states; on every `onUpdate` a **reverse search** finds the latest entry whose `t` has passed and renders its text. Display jumps between states with no animation between them — the realism comes from the schedule shape: fast keystroke clusters (0.06–0.20s apart), pauses at word breaks (0.3–0.6s), a typo, backspaces peeling back to the fork, then a bulk paste replacing many chars in one entry. A block cursor blinks via a deterministic sin square wave on the same timeline.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="terminal">
  <div class="prompt">$</div>
  <div class="text-wrap">
    <span class="text" id="text"></span><span class="cursor" id="cursor">_</span>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.terminal {
  font-family: {monoFont}; /* monospace required — proportional jitters even in a fixed box */
  display: flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  font-size: TERMINAL_FONT_SIZE;
}
.text-wrap {
  display: inline-flex;
  align-items: baseline;
  min-width: TEXT_WRAP_MIN_WIDTH; /* ≥ widest state — stops right-edge jitter */
  white-space: nowrap;
}
.cursor {
  display: inline-block; /* inline ignores width */
  width: CURSOR_WIDTH;
}
```

```js
// Each entry shows from its t until the NEXT entry's t.
// Shape: keystrokes → typo → backspace to the fork → bulk paste → completion mark.
const SEQUENCE = [
  { t: 0.0, text: "" },
  { t: T_K1, text: "{p1}" }, // first keystrokes (~3-5 chars, 0.1-0.2s apart)
  { t: T_K2, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_typo}" }, // continuation containing a typo
  { t: T_BS, text: "{p1 + ' ' + p2_partial}" }, // backspace(s) — peel back to the fork
  { t: T_BULK, text: "{fullCorrectedText}" }, // bulk paste — many chars in one jump
  { t: T_DONE, text: "{fullCorrectedText + ' ✓'}" }, // completion marker
];

// Reverse-search for the latest entry whose t has passed
function textAt(time) {
  for (let i = SEQUENCE.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
    if (time >= SEQUENCE[i].t) return SEQUENCE[i].text;
  }
  return "";
}

const textEl = document.getElementById("text");
const cursorEl = document.getElementById("cursor");

const driver = { t: 0 };
tl.to(
  driver,
  {
    t: TOTAL_DURATION,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = textAt(driver.t);
    },
  },
  0,
);

// Cursor blink — deterministic sin square wave, never a CSS animation
const blink = { p: 0 };
tl.to(
  blink,
  {
    p: Math.PI * 2 * BLINK_CYCLES,
    duration: TOTAL_DURATION,
    ease: "none",
    onUpdate: () => {
      cursorEl.style.opacity = Math.sin(blink.p) > 0 ? "1" : "0";
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

## Variations

- **Smooth character slice** (continuous typewriter — no pauses, no edits): faster to author but uniformly "machine-typed", missing the human realism:

```js
const fullText = "{fullPhrase}";
const len = { v: 0 };
tl.to(
  len,
  {
    v: fullText.length,
    duration: TYPE_DUR,
    ease: "power1.inOut",
    onUpdate: () => {
      textEl.textContent = fullText.substring(0, Math.floor(len.v));
    },
  },
  0,
);
```

- **Thinking pause** — hold one state for `THINK_HOLD_DUR` (0.8–2.0s; under 0.5s reads as a stutter, not thought) simply by leaving a gap before the next entry's `t`.
- **State pulse on completion** — when the final state lands, `tl.to(".text", { scale: 1.03–1.08, duration: 0.15–0.3, yoyo: true, repeat: 1 }, T_DONE)`.
- **Per-state color shift** — in `onUpdate`, branch on `driver.t` vs the milestones: success color after `T_DONE`, dim mid-edit, normal while typing.

## Critical Constraints

- **Reverse-search the array each frame** — O(n) with small n (≤30 typical); don't index by frame, the sequence is sparse.
- **`min-width` on the text wrap is mandatory** — without it the right edge jitters as state length changes.
- **Discrete jumps must be INSTANT** — any transition on the text turns the jump into a smear and kills the "typing" feel.
- **Cursor blink is sin/sequence-driven on the timeline**, `display: inline-block`, monospace font, `white-space: nowrap` (wrapping mid-state breaks the illusion; trailing spaces must survive).
- **Discrete vs smooth** — use discrete only for non-linear states (typos, pauses, bulk paste); plain typing takes the smooth-slice variation.

# Motion-Blur Streak

Real motion blur isn't available to a seeked renderer (it integrates over shutter time), so this rule **fakes** it for a fast fly-in or hard camera push-through. The whole point is the _coupling_: the blur envelope rides the **same ease and window** as the position tween, so peak blur lands exactly on peak speed and the element is razor-sharp the instant it stops. Two paths:

- **(A) Directional SVG blur** — inline `<feGaussianBlur stdDeviation="X 0">` (X on the motion axis, 0 across it), tweened via a proxy. Cleanest; a true directional smear.
- **(B) Echo / ghost trail** — 2–4 duplicates at decreasing opacity, offset backward along the motion vector, collapsing into the lead as it settles. No filter cost; a stylized "speed-line" trail.

**Entrances and mid-shot moves only — never a mid-composition exit.** A blurred element fleeing off-frame mid-composition reads as a glitch; a hard exit between scenes is the transition's job (`../../transitions/overview.md`). One sanctioned scope extension: the envelope may ride the **camera wrapper** during a travel leg — see the Camera-Travel Carve-Out.

## How It Works

A fast `out`-eased move front-loads velocity — fastest off the start, bleeding to zero at the settle. Map the blur/echo envelope onto that same curve: position travels from an off-frame / pushed-back start to rest over `MOVE_DUR`; in lockstep on the same window and ease the smear goes `PEAK_BLUR → 0` (A) or the ghosts collapse onto the lead (B). By the settle the element is fully crisp and dwells ≥1 s — the contrast between violent streak and still, sharp settle IS the effect. GSAP can't tween an SVG attribute directly: tween a plain `{ v }` proxy and write `setAttribute("stdDeviation", …)` in `onUpdate`, seeding it once at setup so a seek to t=0 shows the streaked start.

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip; overflow: hidden on the scene (the smear extends past rest) -->
<svg width="0" height="0" aria-hidden="true" style="position: absolute">
  <filter id="streak" x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%">
    <feGaussianBlur id="streak-blur" in="SourceGraphic" stdDeviation="0 0" />
  </filter>
</svg>
<div class="streak-el" id="streak-el" style="filter: url(#streak)">{phrase}</div>
<!-- Path B instead: N-1 aria-hidden .streak-ghost duplicates BEHIND the lead, no filter -->
```

```js
// Path A — proxy-tweened directional blur.
const blurNode = document.getElementById("streak-blur");
const blurProxy = { v: PEAK_BLUR };
const writeBlur = () => blurNode.setAttribute("stdDeviation", `${blurProxy.v} 0`); // X axis only
writeBlur(); // seed frame 0 — a seek to t=0 must show the streaked start, not a sharp pre-frame

tl.fromTo(
  "#streak-el",
  { x: ENTER_FROM_X, opacity: 0 },
  { x: 0, opacity: 1, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE },
  MOVE_START,
);
tl.to(blurProxy, { v: 0, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE, onUpdate: writeBlur }, MOVE_START);

// Path B — ghosts on the SAME window/ease; per-ghost variation by index.
gsap.utils.toArray(".streak-ghost").forEach((g) => {
  const i = Number(g.dataset.i); // 1..N-1, set in HTML
  tl.fromTo(
    g,
    { x: ENTER_FROM_X - i * ECHO_STEP_PX, opacity: GHOST_BASE_OPACITY / i },
    { x: 0, opacity: 0, duration: MOVE_DUR, ease: MOVE_EASE },
    MOVE_START,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Vertical streak** — swap axes: `y`, `stdDeviation="0 Y"`, vertical echo offsets.
- **Camera push-through** — `scale: SCALE_FROM → 1` with a symmetric `"B B"` envelope (depth-wise smear, not directional): the wordmark punches out of soft focus and snaps crisp at the lock.
- **Staggered grid streak-in** — each card streaks into its slot at `MOVE_START + i * CARD_STAGGER` with its own blur proxy / ghosts; sharp the instant it lands.
- **Hold-the-streak** — blur on a marginally slower curve than position (position `expo.out`, blur `power3.out`) so the last wisp resolves just after arrival. Sparingly; default is locked envelopes.

## Camera-Travel Carve-Out

The envelope is also sanctioned at **wrapper level**: on the `.world` / camera wrapper of a virtual-camera scene ([viewport-change.md](viewport-change.md), [multi-phase-camera.md](multi-phase-camera.md), [3d-camera-flight.md](3d-camera-flight.md)) during a **travel leg** — a dive, a whip sweep, a violent final push. This does **not** violate "never a mid-composition exit": the world never leaves frame — the camera travels _through_ it, and every leg ends with the world at rest, sharp, inside the frame. Each leg is an **arrival** at the next pose, so the entrance doctrine applies leg by leg. Three deltas from the element-level recipe:

- **Envelope follows the leg's ease.** An `out` leg (dive, final push) uses the base recipe unchanged. An `inOut` repositioning leg peaks mid-leg: split the envelope at the velocity peak — `0 → PEAK` on the in-half ease over the first half, `PEAK → 0` on the out-half over the second. Seed the proxy at **0** for these (the streaked state lives mid-leg, not at t=0; seed-at-`PEAK_BLUR` belongs to the entrance shape, where the first frame IS the fastest).
- **Filter placement.** 2D camera: `filter: url(#streak)` on the `.world` wrapper. 3D flight: on the **perspective stage** above the 3D context — a `filter` on a `preserve-3d` element flattens it and collapses every `translateZ`. Never per-element inside the world: one frame-wide envelope, not N desynced ones.
- **Full-frame blur is heavy** — cap `PEAK_BLUR` ~18–20 at wrapper level (vs 30 for one element); a brief whip may touch ~24. Axis rule as usual: `"X 0"` for a lateral whip/pan, `"B B"` for a dive/push.

### Whip sweep (named composition)

The heavily-blurred lateral whip that resolves into the next region — two rules on one window:

1. **Position** — [nudge-curve.md](nudge-curve.md)'s three-phase chain on the camera state, tuned burst-dominant (tail still ≥3× ramp-in in time).
2. **Blur** — `0 → PEAK` across the ramp-in, held at `PEAK` through the linear burst (constant velocity = constant smear), `PEAK → 0` across the tail.

Swap or reveal the next region's content DURING the burst — the smear masks the change; the `power4.out` tail lands it sharp. Reveal during the burst, read after the tail.

```js
tl.to(cam, { x: WHIP_X * 0.1, duration: 0.12, ease: "power3.in", onUpdate: applyCamera }, WHIP_AT);
tl.to(
  cam,
  { x: WHIP_X * 0.75, duration: 0.1, ease: "none", onUpdate: applyCamera },
  WHIP_AT + 0.12,
);
tl.to(
  cam,
  { x: WHIP_X, duration: 0.35, ease: "power4.out", onUpdate: applyCamera },
  WHIP_AT + 0.22,
);

tl.to(blurProxy, { v: PEAK_BLUR, duration: 0.12, ease: "power3.in", onUpdate: writeBlur }, WHIP_AT);
// blur holds at PEAK through the linear burst (no tween needed — value rests at PEAK)
tl.to(blurProxy, { v: 0, duration: 0.35, ease: "power4.out", onUpdate: writeBlur }, WHIP_AT + 0.22);
```

## Critical Constraints

- Blur peaks at peak speed and resolves to 0 at the settle — share the ease and window between position and envelope. A blur that lingers after the stop reads as a focus pull.
- Entrances / mid-shot arrivals only — never a mid-composition exit; wrapper-level use only per the carve-out.
- Seed `stdDeviation` at setup: at `PEAK_BLUR` for the entrance shape, at 0 for a whip / `inOut` leg.
- Generous filter region (`x="-50%" y="-50%" width="200%" height="200%"`) or the smear clips at the element's box edge.
- Directional axis: `"X 0"` horizontal, `"0 Y"` vertical, `"B B"` only for a depth/scale move — symmetric blur on a sideways move looks like defocus.
- Dwell ≥1 s sharp after the snap; a streak landing at the last beat reads as "flashed and gone".
- Heavy element on a solid field — thin type (< ~120px / 800 weight) or a busy backdrop swallows the smear.
- `overflow: hidden` on the scene — the smear / furthest ghost extends past the resting position during travel.

## Selected motion rule: reactive-displacement

description: Physical collision where an entering element's spring drives the exiting element's displacement — single source of truth makes the motion causally linked.
metadata:
  tags: transition, physics, collision, displacement, spring, causal

# Reactive Displacement

Exit animation of element A is mathematically DERIVED from the entry spring of element B — a causal link: "A moves _because_ B hit it." Distinct from [scale-swap-transition.md](scale-swap-transition.md) (which overlaps but isn't causal) and [card-morph-anchor.md](card-morph-anchor.md) (one container morphing).

A single 0→1 driver tween (the "entry spring") feeds three concurrent derived motions in one `onUpdate`:

- **Intruder** (B, entering): position interpolated off-stage → settled over the full driver, plus tilt settling to 0° and a sharp early opacity reveal.
- **Victim** (A, exiting): position interpolated settled → off-stage in the OPPOSITE direction, completing at `VICTIM_FRACTION` (~0.4–0.5) of the driver — NOT 1.0.

The victim finishing BEFORE the intruder's entry creates the "hit then settle" rhythm; sharing one eased driver makes the impact moment mathematically synchronized.

## Recipe

```js
// Both cards absolutely centered; overflow: hidden on the scene (off-stage travel);

```

## Variations

- **Impact rotation on victim** — the victim also rotates as it slides: `const victimRot = victimP * -VICTIM_KICK_DEG;` appended to its transform. `VICTIM_KICK_DEG` 15–25°, magnitude matched to the perceived intruder weight.
- **Vertical collision** — intruder from top, victim displaced downward; same math on Y. Reads as "weight dropped on it."
- **Wobble after settle** — after the intruder centers, a damped sine wobble (`±WOBBLE_AMP_DEG` rotation, linearly decaying over `WOBBLE_DUR` via a second `ease: "none"` driver at `DRIVER_AT + DRIVER_DUR`) before stillness — "impact aftermath."
- **Multi-victim ripple** — the intruder displaces multiple aligned cards, each victim's `victimP` on a slightly offset driver phase (cascade ripple).

| DRIVER_DUR        | 0.6–1.4 s              | short = zippy punch, long = heavy landed impact; higher bounce on long durations reads as floaty           |
| BOUNCE_FACTOR     | 1.2–2.0 (typ. 1.4–1.6) | stay in the `back.out` family (or `elastic.out` for oscillation) — changing family rewrites the feel       |
| VICTIM_FRACTION   | 0.4–0.5                | <0.4 the victim disappears before the impact reads; >0.5 feels parallel, not causal; hard cap ~0.6         |

| INTRUDER_TILT     | 5–15° (typ. ~10°)      | low = clean glide, high = "spin-and-plant"; sign consistent with entry direction (momentum transfer)       |
| FADE_IN_SHARPNESS | 3–8                    | intruder reaches opacity 1 at `1/FADE_IN_SHARPNESS` of progress; must be > 1 or it's transparent at center |
| DWELL_MIN         | ≥ 1.0 s (typ. 1.0–1.5) | post-impact dwell is where the new content gets read — do not skip                                         |

## Critical Constraints

- **Single driver = single source of truth** — both motions computed inside ONE driver's `onUpdate`, never separate `tl.to()` calls per element; independent tweens destroy the causal link (they'd merely be near each other in time).
- **Victim completes at a fraction of the driver** — the "hit" is the overlap moment; after it the victim is just vacating space the intruder will fill.
- **Directional momentum transfer** — same axis, opposite directions; different axes read as passing, not colliding.
- **Intruder z-index above victim** — explicit, not DOM order; otherwise the victim looks like it tunneled through.
- **Intruder enters tilted, settles flat** — small initial tilt → 0° reads as "spinning in then planting."
- **Climax dwell after impact** — the impact is the headline beat; hold the settled intruder ≥ DWELL_MIN.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the scene** — off-stage motion exceeds the frame.

# Vertical Spring Ticker (Slot Machine)

Multiple spring tweens are ADDED TOGETHER to produce total Y translation — each spring contributes one discrete "step", so instead of a single linear scroll you get the slot-machine "click click click" rhythm with natural settling. Distinct from a continuous marquee: this rule's semantics are discrete steps that land; for endless linear motion see [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md).

## How It Works

A masked window of fixed height `ITEM_HEIGHT` (`overflow: hidden`) holds a vertical stack of items, each exactly `ITEM_HEIGHT` tall. Each spring holds a 0→1 progress; a shared `onUpdate` sums them and applies `translateY(-sum × ITEM_HEIGHT)`. Springs fire sequentially with overlap (`STEP_SPACING ≤ STEP_DUR`), so each step snaps in while the previous is still settling — that overlap is what makes them additive, and the `back.out` overshoot is what makes each step read as a "click".

## Recipe

```html
<!-- inside a standard scene clip (hyperframes-core) -->
<div class="ticker" id="ticker">
  <div class="stack-inner" id="stack-inner">
    <div class="item">{item0}</div>
    <div class="item">{item1}</div>
    <div class="item">{itemN}</div>
  </div>
</div>
```

```css
.ticker {
  width: TICKER_WIDTH;
  height: ITEM_HEIGHT; /* MUST match .item height exactly */
  overflow: hidden; /* the mask is the window */
}
.stack-inner {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column; /* mandatory — vertical stacking */
}
.item {
  height: ITEM_HEIGHT; /* MUST equal .ticker height */
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
  /* font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums; — for numeric tickers */
}
```

```js
const innerEl = document.getElementById("stack-inner");
const springs = Array.from({ length: STEPS }, () => ({ p: 0 }));

function applyTransform() {
  const sumP = springs.reduce((acc, s) => acc + s.p, 0);
  innerEl.style.transform = `translateY(${-sumP * ITEM_HEIGHT}px)`;
}
applyTransform(); // initial state

springs.forEach((spring, i) => {
  tl.to(
    spring,
    {
      p: 1,
      duration: STEP_DUR,
      ease: `back.out(${BOUNCE_FACTOR})`,
      onUpdate: applyTransform,
    },
    STEP_START + i * STEP_SPACING,
  );
});
```

## Variations

- **Numeric ticker (price / counter rolling)** — items are the digit sequence; run the same spring-step pattern per decimal position. `font-variant-numeric: tabular-nums` required.
- **Reverse direction (countdown)** — flip the sign (`translateY(${sumP * ITEM_HEIGHT}px)`) and arrange items in reverse order.
- **Pause between groups** — several fast steps (small `STEP_SPACING`), a long pause, then one dramatic final step with a bigger `BOUNCE_FACTOR`. The pause is where the eye locks in.
- **Continuous infinite ticker** — NOT this rule (this rule is discrete steps); a looping news ticker is a single linear tween with duplicated items — see [sine-wave-loop.md](sine-wave-loop.md) for continuous-motion semantics.

| STEP_SPACING  | 0.3–0.5s              | **≤ STEP_DUR** so springs overlap (additive); wider gaps read as a lazy linear scroll |

## Critical Constraints

- **Container height = item height, pixel-exact, all items equal** — mismatches show partial item edges above/below the mask and accumulate drift across steps.
- **`overflow: hidden` on the container, not the inner stack**; `flex-direction: column` on the stack.
- **Sum the springs in `onUpdate` — never tween the final position directly.** Each spring contributing its OWN snap is the slot-machine pacing.
- **Overlap steps and keep `back.out` per step** — non-overlapping steps or an out-only ease collapse into a linear scroll.
- **Never update items via `innerHTML` between steps** — the ticker moves the SAME items via translate; swapping content shows the previous item AS the new one (broken illusion).
- **Climax dwell ≥1s after the final step** (SKILL universal constraint).
- **`tabular-nums` for numeric tickers** — variable digit widths break alignment.
